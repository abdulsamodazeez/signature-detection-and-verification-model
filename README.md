Signature Detection and Verification Model

# Introduction
The Signature Detection and Verification Model is an advanced deep learning model that aims to detect and verify signatures. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify signatures with high accuracy. The model can be used in various applications such as document authentication, fraud detection, and signature recognition systems.

This project provides the necessary code and instructions to train and evaluate the signature detection and verification model on your own dataset.

# Features
Signature detection: Automatically locate and extract signatures from images or documents.
Signature verification: Determine the authenticity of a signature by comparing it with a reference signature.
High accuracy: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for improved performance.

# Usage
To use the Signature Detection and Verification Model, follow these steps:

- Prepare your dataset by organizing signature images and corresponding labels (genuine or forged).
- Train the model
- Evaluate the trained model 
- 
# Dataset
The Signature Detection and Verification Model requires a labeled dataset of signature images. The dataset should be organized into the following structure:
```bash
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── genuine/
│   │   ├── genuine_001.jpg
│   │   ├── genuine_002.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── forged/
│       ├── forged_001.jpg
│       ├── forged_002.jpg
│       └── ...
└── test/
    ├── genuine/
    │   ├── genuine_001.jpg
    │   ├── genuine_002.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── forged/
        ├── forged_001.jpg
        ├── forged_002.jpg
        └── ...
```        
Make sure to have a sufficient number of training and test samples for each class (genuine and forged) to achieve good model performance.

# Model Architecture
The Signature Detection and Verification Model utilizes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It consists of several convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers and output layers for
